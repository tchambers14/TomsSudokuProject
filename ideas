1. Download grids from the internet
2. Display
3. Build Grid as a class
    - Functions are check if number in row
    - Have a display grid method

For the main loop:

While grid contains a 0 keep iterating.

Next step
Solve with a neural network

Do I need a model for each box, row and column
    - i.e. if box 7 must have a 2 in row 2 that has an impact on boxes 8 and 9
